# 🐝 BEE: Multi-Domain Autonomous Drone Project

The **BEE Project** is a modular research platform for developing and testing autonomous UAV capabilities in simulation and embedded hardware. It integrates multiple subsystems under one repository, enabling a complete workflow from **low-level flight control** to **high-level perception and mapping**.

BEE is designed as a flexible sandbox for experimenting with new ideas in **autonomous navigation, perception, and communication pipelines**.

## ✈️ Core Components

1. **Flight Controller Development (Simulation)**
    
    Custom controllers for UAV stabilization and navigation, tested in simulation with Gazebo/ROS 2. Includes PID-based stabilization, teleoperation scripts, and prototype autonomous control pipelines.
    
2. **Monocular Vision Depth Perception (Depth Anything V2)**
    
    A deep-learning-based pipeline for monocular depth estimation using *Depth Anything V2*. Generates dense depth maps for 3D scene reconstruction, odometry, and SLAM integration.
      
3. **Structure-from-Motion (SfM) & Visual Odometry**
    
    Multiple pipelines for reconstructing 3D structure from images, including ray-based triangulation, feature-based SfM, and temporal visual odometry. Provides research flexibility for comparing algorithms.

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

1. **Simulate the Drone** – Launch Gazebo worlds with the BEE URDF and control nodes.
2. **Enable Flight Control** – Run stabilization/teleop scripts for manual or assisted flight.
3. **Add Perception** – Launch the Depth Anything V2 pipeline for depth-aware perception.
4. **Transmit Data** – Use the ESP32-CAM telemetry stack for live video and state streaming.
5. **Experiment with SfM** – Run visual odometry and structure-from-motion pipelines for 3D reconstruction.
